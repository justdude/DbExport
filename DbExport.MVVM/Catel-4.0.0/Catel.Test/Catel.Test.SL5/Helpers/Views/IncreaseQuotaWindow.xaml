            To run all unit tests of Catel, it is required to increase the quota of the isolated storage file.
            
            In a perfect world, I (the software) could do this for you, but since there are always people abusing such
            features, the increase of the storage needs to be a user-initiated event.
            
            Therefore the kind request, click "OK" to increase the isolated storage in order for all unit tests to succeed.
